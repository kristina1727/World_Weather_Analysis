# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to make updates to our PlanMyTrip app. It was requested that we add the description to the marker in the weather data and then to create a travel rout between 4 cities of the testers choosing. 

To create the App we used the following APIs:
- OpenWeatherMap
- Google
  - Places
  - Directions
  - Maps JavaScript
